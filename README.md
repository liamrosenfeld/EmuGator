# EmuGator
University of Florida Computer Engineering Design Project

## Completed Work
The assembler, front-end, and user-interface are now connected. Users can step through programs. Most instructions in the RV-32I instruction set are implemented except ECALL. The assembler assembles the code and detects syntax errors and displays them in the code editor. The UI includes syntax highlighting and allows users to step through clock cycles through calls to the emulator functions. Users can see the current instruction executing, the last instruction fetched, registers, instruction memory, and data memory. The user can also use the uart module to print text to the built-in console.

## Project Architecture

### Emugator Web

Monaco, Tailwind, and Dioxus Frontend
The architecture of the editor was designed and established during the pre-alpha stage. It consists of two key components:
- **Low-Level Component**: Manages adding and activating the Monaco editor to the DOM.
- **Top-Level Component**: Provides default configurations to improve appearance and expose the model of the editor to the Dioxus state life cycle.

Remaining architectural challenges include:
- Implementing hover documentation

### EmuGator Core

#### Emulator

The emulator is modeled as a finite state machine. Instructions are decoded according to the instruction formats defined in the [RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set Version 2.0](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf). Each instruction resolves to an instruction handler that consumes the current state and produces the next state. This design allows the ability to replay states forwards or backwards, facilitating debugging of programs executed on the platform.

The emulator's internal state is modeled after the OpenHW CVE2 2-stage pipelined RISC-V processor. By reviewing the top-level SystemVerilog file, we extracted the CVE2's datapath and pipeline components to enable cycle-level debugging.

Modifications were made to the original design of CVE2 better this context of an emulator made for education. Modifications include:
- Control lines were moved from the decoder to the controller to better match textbooks
- Branching has been reworked to not use branch prediction
- CSR instructions are a nop because there is no hardware to interface with
- Fence instructions are a nop because there is no hardware to interface with

#### Assembler
The assembler is long yet simple and integrates with the frontend to take in assembly code as input, producing machine code output for the emulator.

The assembler operates on a two-pass system:
1. **First Pass**: Looks at labels and memory sections (e.g., `.data` and `.text`), associating labels with memory addresses.
2. **Second Pass**: Generates the actual machine code.

The main function, `assemble`, handles the assembly string and coordinates the parsing passes.

### Emugator CLI

An autograder command line tool built on the same foundation as the web tool.

## Known Bugs
- UART input can sometimes cause user text to appear over characters that have been read in already.

## Development

### Building Web Application Locally
1. Install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. Install the tailwind css cli: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
3. Install Rust and Cargo: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html 
4. Install the Dioxus CLI: `cargo install dioxus-cli`
5. Then run these two commands in parallel in `/emugator_web/`
  - `cd emugator_web/`
  - Start Tailwind compiler: `npm run tailwind-dev`
  - Start Dioxus developement server: `dx serve`
6. Open the browser to http://localhost:8080

### Running Command-line Interface and AutoGrader
1. Install Rust and Cargo: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html 
2. cd into `/emugator_cli`
3. run `cargo run -- [--programs filename] [--tests filename] [--timeout time]`
  - example: cargo run -- test --programs ../test-files --tests ../test-files/test-dir --timeout 1000
4. Add new tests by placing a folder for each test case in the test directory and then adding `expectedstate.json` with the proper output (registers, data, and text output) and `input.txt` with what you want the input text buffer to be.
